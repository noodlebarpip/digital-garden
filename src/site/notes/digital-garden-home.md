# pip install nerd

Hello, World! I’m pip (they/them). I’m a queer neurodivergent nerd who loves info-dumping. This blog is my way of giving a respite to my friends who have to listen to me. I’ll try to divide this blog into a science section, a creative writing section, and other hobbies section, but there will be some overlap. Hope you like it here!

You can contact at me [via email.](mailto:kokiaoakenlimb@gmail.com)
