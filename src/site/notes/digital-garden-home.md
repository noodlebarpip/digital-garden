# pip install nerd

Hello, World! Iâ€™m pip (they/them). Iâ€™m a queer neurodivergent nerd who loves info-dumping. This blog is my way of giving a respite to my friends who have to listen to me. Iâ€™ll try to divide this blog into a science section, a creative writing section, and other hobbies section, but there will be some overlap. Hope you like it here!

You can contact at me [via email.](mailto:kokiaoakenlimb@gmail.com) Please let me know if you see any errors I need to correct or if you want me to know anything.

[[table-of-contents\|You can look at some WIP here.]]
